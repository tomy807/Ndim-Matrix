# Ndim-Matrix
N-dimensional Matrix like Eigen

# Supporting matrix operations
- reshape
- block
- row, col 
- transpose
- add, sub, mul 
- reduction scalar assignment, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

# ToDoList
- Inner product
- Matrix multiplication
- Outer product
- LUP decomposition + Gaussian elimination
- QR decomposition
- Deteminant, Trace
- Norm
- Vector normalization
- Singular Value Decomposition (able to low rank approx SVD)
- Matrix Inverse, Pseudoinverse
- Eigenvalues + Eigenvectors
